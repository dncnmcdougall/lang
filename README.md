# lang
A flight of fancy to build a language


This is a simple language I wrote on a whim.
Currently it supports basic operations, as well as user defined funtions and recursion.
It is easy to extend by adding "primities" and it is easy to make the primitives evaluate their parameters lazily.

HTere is, obviously, much room for improvement.
