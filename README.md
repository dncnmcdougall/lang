# lang
A flight of fancy to build a language


This is a simple language I wrote on a whim.
Currently it supports basic operations, as well as user defined functions and recursion.
It is easy to extend by adding "primitives" and it is easy to make the primitives evaluate their parameters lazily.

Here is, obviously, much room for improvement.
